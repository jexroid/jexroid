  my journey to IT started in my old childhood when I was around 5 years old my parents bought me a lot of electronic stuff, such as a phone, toy cars, and playstation2.my entertainment was opening them and understanding how they are working. this curiosity leads me to the IT world, I learned about networks, web applications, android, windows, Linux, and half of the popular programming languages syntax such as PHP, Python, C#, C++, Dart, Javascript, etc...I love this world more than anything in my life because I can say this is what I have been made for, every time I'm behind my PC I feel peace and happiness in myself. I have an extreme hunger for learning about anything in IT! this is my goal right now, to learn and learn and learn till I found something necessary in this IT world and add invent that, just at that moment I can feel relaxed and calm for the rest of my life.
  
  so it's gonna be a long journey!
